CQL Cassandra driver
====================

This library uses the [cql](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cql) library
which implements Cassandra's CQL protocol and complements it with the
neccessary I/O operations. The feature-set includes:

*Node discovery*

The driver discovers nodes automatically from a small set of bootstrap nodes.

*Customisable load-balancing policies*

In addition to pre-built LB policies such as round-robin, users of this
library can provide their own policies if desired.

*Support for connection streams*

Requests can be multiplexed over a few connections.

*Customisable retry settings*

Support for default retry settings as well as local overrides per query.

*Prepared queries*

Prepared queries are an optimisation which parse and prepare a query only
once on Cassandra nodes but execute it many times with different concrete
values.

*TLS support*

Client to node communication can optionally use transport layer security
(using HsOpenSSL).

Testing
=======

Running the tests in the root folder (using stack test) with start up a 
Cassandra node using docker. As such, docker should be installed in order
to run the test cases
